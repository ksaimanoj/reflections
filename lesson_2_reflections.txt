1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
On initializing a repository, a .git folder is added. It means that git has started tracking the folder for changes. We need to do it because we cannot use version control without tracking the changes in the folder.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory is the folder or version-control on which we are working on. Repository is the image of all the files in the staging area at the time of commit. Staging area helps to select files that we want to add to the repository and the commit all at once for the added files. If some group of files are changed for a particular commit, we can add only those files to the staging area for that particular commit.
