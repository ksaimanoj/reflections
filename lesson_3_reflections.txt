When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all the work local?

Remote repostiroy can be used to update commits (and the files) to the GitHub website.
I would want to use it whenever I am upadating anything to GitHub. Why would I want to upload anything to GitHub?
Well it can allow others to contribute and criticize my work (as if the criticism is not enough already).
Morever I will have an online backup of all my work. The downside is it will be public (for some it may not be a downside).
